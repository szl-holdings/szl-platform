"""The evidence sink: sign synchronously, persist asynchronously, chain always.

Shape of the thing:

* The LiteLLM hook signs (receipt construction + content addressing happen
  inline, on the request path) and does a *synchronous, non-blocking*
  enqueue. The request path never waits on disk.
* A single background flusher task owns the files. It collects receipts for
  up to ``flush_interval_s`` seconds or ``batch_size`` receipts, whichever
  comes first, then appends them to ``receipts.jsonl`` as hash-chained
  entries (:func:`szl_receipts.append` semantics: ``seq``, ``prev``,
  ``entry_digest``). Each batch rewrites the ledger crash-atomically: the
  full new contents go to a temp file in the same directory, which is
  fsynced and then renamed over ``receipts.jsonl``. One writer means no
  interleaving and no sequence races; the atomic rename means a crash
  mid-batch leaves the previous ledger, never a truncated or torn one.
* On restart the sink re-reads ``receipts.jsonl`` and offers it to
  :func:`szl_receipts.verify_chain`. **A corrupt on-disk chain refuses to
  boot** — continuing to append onto a tampered tail would manufacture
  false confidence. ``read_only=True`` opens the sink for inspection
  (``stats``, ``iterate``) without booting a flusher; verification that only
  reads should use :func:`verify_sink`, which needs no event loop at all.

Backpressure: when the bounded queue is full, FAIL_CLOSED raises
:class:`EvidenceBackpressure` (the caller's request fails loudly, per
policy) and FAIL_OPEN drops the receipt and increments ``dropped_counter``.
A dropped receipt is a *loud* signal: it is counted, surfaced in
:meth:`EvidenceSink.stats`, and one loud line is appended for the first drop
of each drop-streak. Silent loss is the one thing an evidence plane may
never do.

Files in the sink directory:

* ``receipts.jsonl`` — one chain entry per line (append-only chain, replaced atomically)
* ``evidence/<digest>.json`` — content-addressed evidence documents
* ``bodies/<digest>.json`` — captured bodies, only when capture is enabled
* ``chain_head.json`` — checkpoint {seq, entry_digest, entries} after each batch
* ``drops.jsonl`` — one line per drop-streak, only when FAIL_OPEN drops occur

           ledger has always been written with, so the bytes are unchanged.
        2. Flush and fsync it, so its bytes are durable before the ledger
           name points at them. On POSIX it takes the old ledger's mode bits.

           new one, never a mix.
